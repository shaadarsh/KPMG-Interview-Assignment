# Terraform code to deploy three-tier architecture on azure

## Problem Statement

1. One virtual network tied in three subnets.
2. Each subnet will have one virtual machine.
3. First virtual machine -> allow inbound traffic from internet only.
4. Second virtual machine -> entertain traffic from first virtual machine only and can reply the same virtual machine again.
5. App can connect to database and database can connect to app but database cannot connect to web.

_Note: Keep main and variable files different for each component_

## Solution

### The Terraform resources will consists of following structure

```
├── main.tf                   // The primary entrypoint for terraform resources.
├── vars.tf                   // It contain the declarations for variables.
├── output.tf                 // It contain the declarations for outputs.
├── terraform.tfvars          // The file to pass the terraform variables values.
```


## Deployment

### Provide below Values in your environment variables to authenticate terraform to azure.

### Steps

**Step 0** `terraform init`

used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files

**Step 1** `terraform plan`

used to create an execution plan

**Step 2** `terraform validate`

validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc

**Step 3** `terraform apply`

used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration

**Step 4 [Optional]** `terraform destroy`

used to destroy the terraform deployed resources
